@Update to handle warning caused by using floats as index in
Matlab version 5. Redefined convention for the center of
the delta function and the mean function at the same time.

@function pixels = deltafcn(xsize, ysize)
%
% DELTAFCN(xsize, ysize) -- generates a discrete delta function of
% support xsize*ysize, in which the central pixel is set to one and 
% all other pixel values are set to zero.

matrix = zeros(xsize, ysize);
matrix(ceil((xsize+1)/2), ceil((ysize+1)/2)) = 1;
